With this blog :

-   I want to publish the notes I take for my projects.
-   I will take note of the challenges and questions I regularly face in my professional activity.
-   I want to confront my notes with the possible audience and my future self.
-   Through creating blogs, I want to clarify my ideas about the published topics.
-    In other words, this blog will be a tool for understanding me :-) .

I will indeed have mistakes in developing the Themes (I'll try not to, but to err is human and a part of intellectual development); Probably, I will not cite or mention the sources at some points in the Blogs by mistake; so I apologize in advance and ask your help correcting them. I can only promise you that I will support the issues with all the literature sources I can find and have available.
