    "title": "Remarks about RIKO plunger valves",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Riko Plunger valves are mainly used where volume flows, or pressure has to be reduced and regulated without vibrations, noises, or significant changes in the pipeline system. RIKO valves are control devices that cause pressure loss in pipeline systems by throttling to modify the flow or pressure so that the desired values are obtained, depending on the degree of opening adjustment.\nThe following advantages are obtained from the plunger valves :\n\nuniversal use wide controllable range;\nlow cavitation coefficient, stable flow, low noise;\nflow block is variable: optimum flow for every operating condition;\nlow drive forces with pressure-relieving fix and mobile cylinder (pistons).\n\nTo size a control valve, the following points must be considered :\n\nThe control valve must permit the maximum flow (1.3 times the maximum flow required for the application ) under the lowest-possible differential pressure.\nThe flow range (maximum, median, and minimum) relative to the degree of opening of the control valve must be such that the regulation circuit is stable.\nIn the entire control range (maximum, median, and minimum), there should be no occurrence of cavitation.\nThe pipeline systems are planned and installed, bearing in mind future requirements. It is often forgotten that control valves designed for these end capacities are over-sized at the start of the operation but not for future needs. Reducing the size of the control valve means generating additional problems and costs in the future of system operation.\n\nOne of the most uncomfortable things that can a hydraulic design to happen is a valve chosen six months or a year ago deteriorating. The most common causes of premature valve failure are:\n\nCavitation damage.\nCavitation and flashing of water (shock flow).\nErosion of the valve.\nVibration (irregular flow pattern with liquids).\nCorrosion.\nLeakages.\n\nTo avoid in any way, the following design criteria must be met [@baumann2009]:\n\nCriteria for valve selection : - Is the valve appropriately sized? - Does the valve have a low dead band, sometimes confused with hysteresis? - Will it be able to operate without a positioner (also a cost factor)? - Does it have adequate rangeability? - Is the flow characteristic acceptable (installed characteristic)? - How is its dynamic performance (frequency response, time constant)?\nInstallation and effects on the environment: - Is face-to-face such that it can be replaced with another make? - How heavy is it? - Are supports needed? - Is it too tall? - Is it going to be noisy under the given flow conditions? - Is there an energy supply (in the case of electric actuators)? - Can it withstand the corrosive effects of fluid and the environment? - Would the valve be cavitating under the given flow conditions? - If outdoors, can the valve and actuator stand extreme weather conditions?\nMaintainability and long-term cost: - Is it easy to repair? - What are the prices of spare parts? - Can the actuator tolerate a vibrating environment? - How is the actuator protected from corrosion? - Is the packing field replaceable? - Is the control cylinders (fixed and mobile) field-replaceable? - Is the actuator able to diagnose the valve?\n\nAnother essential point to consider is the information available. Sizing the flow to the fifth place after the decimal point is all well and good, but only if you know the proper process conditions :\n\nFirst, the valve should be sized to control the maximum flow rate under the lowest-possible differential pressure. But what is maximum flow exactly?\nHow about emergency conditions?\nOn the other hand, should the valve fail open, would the resultant flow be more than the downstream pipe or valve could handle?\nWhat are the correct inlet pressures?\nWhat are the variations in inlet pressures?\nCan you use the head pressure of the pump from the manufacturers published curve? (If you do, use the head pressure corresponding to the maximum flow the valve has to pass, and don’t ignore the static head at the pumps location.)\nHow about line losses?\n\nMy experience is that all these questions will be answered in a vague form from the design people. They don’t know either and have to rely on the input from other departments. The result is usually guesswork with ample safety factors thrown in.\nOnly after reviewing these criteria and deciding on the proper valve type should the subject of cost be considered.\n\n\nBaumann, Hans D.

    "text": "The flow basic characteristic curve (inherent flow characteristic).\nThe characteristic of a control valve is defined as the flow rate depending on the valve’s position. The control valve generates a change in the flow by changing the active area of control piston \\(A\\), assuming a constant differential pressure \\(\\Delta p\\) and a constant density \\(\\rho\\).\nThe valve characteristic curve is a function of the valve position (degree of opening or valve position) \\(vp\\) relative to the flow coefficient at valve position \\(K_v\\) divided by the maximum flow coefficient of the valve (\\(100\\%\\) open) \\(K_{vs}\\).\nThe valve characteristic of the control valves (\\(K_v/K_{vs}\\)) depend of the position of the valve (\\(vp\\)).\n\\[\n  K_v/K_{vs} = f(vp)\n\\]\nThe flow coefficient measurement is strictly positive and the curves are S-shaped and they may be increasing, symmetric or non-symmetric around the inflection point. Therefore, using a function defined for non-positive numbers may seem unrealistic. Consequently, using a function where the independent variable \\(X\\) (valve position \\(vp\\)) is constrained to be positive is preferable. Therefore, a positive sigmoidal function is the most appropriate. The logistic curve (a sigmoidal curve) derives from the cumulative logistic distribution function; the curve is symmetric around the inflection point and it may be parameterised as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  K_v/K_{vs} = f(vp, (b, c, d, e)) =  c + \\frac{d-c}{1 + \\exp( b \\cdot (\\log{(vp)} - \\log{(e)}))}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(d\\) is the higher asymptote, \\(c\\) is the lower asymptote, \\(e\\) is \\(vp\\) value at the inflection point, while \\(b\\) is the slope at the inflection point. As the curve is symmetric, \\(e\\) represents also the \\(vp\\) value producing a response half-way between \\(d\\) and \\(c\\). The parameter \\(b\\) can be positive or negative and, consequently, \\(K_v/K_{vs}\\) may increase or decrease as \\(vp\\) increases.\nThe above function is known as the four-parameter logistic. If necessary, constraints can be put on parameter values, i.e. \\(c\\) can be constrained to \\(0\\) (three-parameter logistic) and, additionally, \\(d\\) can be constrained to 1 (two-parameter logistic).\n\n\nReferences\n\nWagner, Walter.

    "text": "In its simplest terms, cavitation is the two-stage vaporization process simply boiling a liquid, also known as flashing. In a control valve, this vaporization occurs because the pressure of the liquid is reduced, instead of the more common occurrence where the temperature is increased. As fluid passes through a valve just downstream of the orifice area, there is an increase in velocity or kind of energy accompanied by a substantial decrease in pressure or potential energy. This occurs in a place called the vena contracta. If the pressure in this area falls below the vapor pressure of the following fluid, vaporization (boiling) occurs. Vapor bubbles then continue downstream, where the velocity of the liquid begins to slow, and the pressure in the fluid recovers. The vapor bubbles then collapse or implode. Cavitation in control valves occurs only with liquid flows. [ISA S75.05 Control Valve Terminology].\n\n\n\nTypical pressure curve in a control valve; [Wagner, Walter. Control and safety fittings]\n\n\nIts effect on the system’s cavitation varies with valve type, size, operating pressure, and installation details. To include cavitation in the design process is necessary to determine if cavitation will evaluate its intensity, characterize the flow conditions, and estimate its effect on the system and environment. Possible consequences include noise, vibration, erosion damage, and a decrease in performance.\nIn the case of control valves, it is conventional to describe the application in terms of a single parameter and then compare this parameter to different limits of operation for a given control element.\nCharacterizing the flow conditions corresponding to a selected cavitation level requires defining a cavitation index derived from dimensional analysis. The process involves determining the fluid properties, geometric characteristics, and parameters influencing the cavitation process. The main variables affecting the cavitation process are:\n\nthe geometric configuration of the device,\nabsolute pressure in the cavitating region,\nthe critical pressure, generally assumed to be the liquid-vapor pressure and velocity or pressure drop\n\nThe cavitation index sigma \\((\\sigma)\\) is a form of another dimensionless parameter. Sigma \\((\\sigma)\\) is constant for either SI or US Customary units as long as the same pressure units are used throughout the equations for the parameter. This index \\((\\sigma)\\) is the ratio of fluid forces trying to prevent cavitation (the system or service pressure) to the forces trying to cause cavitation (the pressure drop). The smaller the value of the cavitation index for a flow system, the more likely or, the more severe cavitation will be.\nThe force suppressing cavitation is proportional to the magnitude of the average pressure relative to absolute vapor pressure i.e. \\((P-P_r)\\). The force causing cavitation is proportional to the velocity head \\(V^2/2g\\) or to the pressure drop across the valve \\(\\Delta P\\). The resulting cavitation parameter sigma can be expressed as [@tullis1993]:\n\\[\n  \\sigma_1 = \\frac{P_1-P_v}{\\Delta P_{net}}\n\\]\nin which:\n\n\\(P_1\\) is the absolute pressure just upstream from the valve \\((P_l = P_u + P_b)\\),\n\\(P_u\\) is the gauge pressure just upstream from the valve,\n\\(P_b\\) is the atmospheric or barometric pressure,\n\\(P_v\\) is the absolute vapor pressure of water and\n\\(\\Delta P_{net}\\) the net pressure drop across the valve \\((P_1 - P_2)\\).\nThe minimum value of sigma (\\(\\sigma_1\\)) is \\(1.0\\) since the maximum \\(\\Delta P_{net}\\) across the valve is \\((P_1 - P_v)\\).\n\nFor cavitation caused by surface roughness, an isolated roughness, an offset in the boundary, or by any device for which it is not possible or convenient to evaluate a pressure differential, for the calculation of the cavitation can be used the velocity head in place of \\(\\Delta{P}\\) in the Equation of \\(\\sigma\\). The resulting Equation is:\n\\[\n  \\sigma_{1_{roug}} = \\frac{P_1-P_v}{(V^2/2g)}\n\\]\nFor valves and other devices that create a pressure drop, the cavitation parameter can be defined in several ways. The reference pressure in the numerator of the equation of sigma \\((\\sigma_1)\\) equation can be either the upstream or the downstream pressure. Both have been used, and there are valid reasons supporting either choice.Using the downstream pressure \\(P_2\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[\n  \\sigma_{2} = \\frac{P_2-P_v}{\\Delta P_{net}}\n\\]\nIn which \\(P_2\\) is the absolute downstream pressure (\\(P_2 = P_d + P_b\\)), where \\(P_d = P_u - \\Delta P_{net}\\) and \\(P_b\\) is the barometric pressure.\nThis form is preferred because the downstream pressure is the pressure closer to the zone where the cavitation occurs. Therefore, the downstream pressure more directly influences the cavitation. However, it is more convenient to use the upstream pressure for most applications, and the two sigma values differ by a constant value of \\(1.0\\). The following simple equation directly relates to the equation:\n\\[\n  \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_{1} + 1\n\\]\nSome publications use the reciprocal of Equation for \\(\\sigma_1\\) and define the cavitation index as \\(K_c\\) instead of \\(\\sigma_1\\). The equation that defines \\(K_c\\) is:\n\\[\n  K_c = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{1}} = \\frac{\\Delta P_{net}}{(P_1-P_v)}\n\\]\nUsing use the reciprocal of Equation for \\(\\sigma_1\\). Some publications, authors, and valve manufacturers also add a safety factor to the cavitation parameter \\(\\sigma_1\\) to account for possible cavitation caused by any device for which it is not possible or convenient to assess a pressure differential near the control valve, so:\n\\[\n  \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{3}}  = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{1}} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{1_{roug}}}=  \\frac{\\Delta P_{net}}{(P_1-P_v)} + \\frac{(V^2/2g)}{(P_1-P_v)}\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{3}}  = \\frac{\\Delta P_{net} + (V^2/2g)}{(P_1-P_v)}\n\\] So:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{3} = = \\frac{(P_1-P_v)}{\\Delta P_{net} + (V^2/2g)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nCavitation causes noise, pressure fluctuations, vibrations, and erosion damage and can reduce the valve’s capacity in advanced stages. The acceptable cavitation level for a valve in a given system varies with valve type, valve function, details of the piping layout, and operation duration.It is necessary to identify and provide experimental data for several cavitation intensity levels to have adequate information for analysis and design. There are defined six different cavitation design limits. The methods used to determine each limit experimentally are defined, and suggestions when each limit might be appropriate. These limits are [@tullis1993 and ISA-RP75.23-1995]:\n\nIncipient cavitation \\(\\sigma_{i}\\)\n\nOnset of cavitation\nDetect using high-frequency vibration measurement\nVery local phenomenon\nTransient: random “ticks” sound\nLow-level cavitation: usually not damaging\nOccurs before the loss of flow capacity\n\nCritical (or constant) cavitation \\(\\sigma_{c}\\)\n\nMore regular cavitation events\nLower frequency sound and vibration sensed: “rumbling” sound\nSome surface damage may occur: dependent upon valve and trim styles and materials.\n\nMaximum noise and vibration level \\(\\sigma_{mv}\\)\n\nHighest vibration amplitude: sounds like “marbles” or “gravel.”\nVigorous, large-scale cavitation\nVery high damage potential\n\nChoked flow \\(\\sigma_{ch}\\)\n\nChoking” cavitation is a most severe level of cavitation.\nThe maximum noise, vibration, and material damage levels occur at or just before this condition.\nUnder “fully choked” flow conditions, an additional decrease in the downstream pressure will not increase the flow rate through the valve at a given inlet pressure. In other words, it is a limiting flow condition in which vapor formation is enough to limit the valve’s flow rate to some maximum value.\nThe choking “process” occurs over a range of pressure drops due to the compressibility changes accompanying vapor formation.\n\n\n\n\nCavitation parameter plot: using an accelerometer values."
